    "커널 서포트 벡터 머신은 강력한 모델이며 다양한 데이터셋에서 잘 작동합니다. SVM은 데이터의 특성이 몇 개 안 되더라도 복잡한 결정 경계를 만들 수 있습니다. 저차원과 고차원의 데이터(즉 특성이 적을 때와 많을 때)에 모두 잘 작동하지만 샘플이 많을 때는 잘 맞지 않습니다. 10,000개의 샘플 정도면 SVM 모델이 잘 작동하겠지만 100,000개 이상의 데이터셋에서는 속도와 메모리 관점에서 도전적인 과제입니다.\n",

    "SVM의 또 하나의 단점은 데이터 전처리와 매개변수 설정에 신경을 많이 써야 한다는 점입니다. 그래서 요즘엔 사람들 대부분이 랜덤 포레스트나 그래디언트 부스팅 같은 (전처리가 거의 또는 전혀 필요 없는) 트리 기반 모델을 애플리케이션에 많이 사용합니다. 더군다나 SVM 모델은 분석하기도 어렵습니다. 예측이 어떻게 결정되었는지 이해하기 어렵고 비전문가에게 모델을 설명하기가 난해합니다.\n",
